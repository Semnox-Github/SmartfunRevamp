How to configure a new app for a customer
=========================================

# 1. Initial setup
1. Install Flutter following official documentation: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
2. Be sure you are able to run the demo counter flutter app created by: `flutter create`
3. Make sure git user has access to auxiliar repositories:
  - https://github.com/nitinpai-semnox/Parafait-BarCodeReader
  - https://github.com/nitinpai-semnox/Parafait-NFC 
4. Be sure to be able to run semnox app in development mode with: `flutter run`

# 2. Change application id
- Open every file with the string: `com.example.semnox`, the list of files is
```
  - SmartFunRevamp/android/app/build.gradle
  - SmartFunRevamp/android/app/google-services.json
  - SmartFunRevamp/android/app/src/debug/AndroidManifest.xml
  - SmartFunRevamp/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
  - SmartFunRevamp/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/example/semnox/MainActivity.kt
  - SmartFunRevamp/android/app/src/profile/AndroidManifest.xml
```
- Replace the string with the application id selected for this project

# 3. Configure .env file
1. Copy the file .env.example to .env
2. These are the values of this files, explained:
  - GET_BASE_URL: the default url for the API that will be called first time the app runs
  - SECRET_KEY: the secret key used for authentication against the api
  - BUILD_NUMBER: app version number, used to check if there is a new version available against api
  - BUILD_SECURITY_CODE: security code for the build to send to the api with the version number
  - USE_LOCAL_CMS_JSON: if true, the app will use the local json file for CMS configuration. If false, the app will fetch the configuration from the API. Only for using during development, for production this should be false

# 4. Firebase keys
Follow instructions on official Firebase documentation https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup

# 5. Google authentication keys
Functionality not implemented yet

# 6. Google maps keys
Follow instructions on official Goole Maps package documentation https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutter

# 7. Native splash screen
This is the screen that is shown natively in the app before the flutter app is loaded
1. Save chosen image file in `SmartFunRevamp/assets/splash_screen/splash_screen.png` (you can change the name of the file, but you need to update the name in the next step).
2. Open file `SmartFunRevamp/flutter_native_splash.yaml` and update `background_image` and `color`. You can ommit this step if you used the default name for the image file in the step 1
4. Run generation tool: `flutter pub pub run flutter_native_splash:create`

# 8. Native icon app
This is the icon of the app that is shown in the device berfore opening the app
1. Save image file in `SmartFunRevamp/assets/icon/icon.png` (you change the name of the file, but you need to update the name in the step 3). PNG file with transparent background is recommended
2. Open file `SmartFunRevamp/flutter_native_icons.yaml` and update image path if you change it in the step 1
3. Run generation tool: `flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons`

# 9. json configuration
There are serveral parts of the app that can be configured by json files. For every configuration there is a file that is shipped inside the app and that is read by default the first time the app is opened. After that, the app will fetch a new configuration from the API and will store it in the device. The json local file and the API response are merged and the result is stored in the device, so they should have the same format.

_WARNING: this feature is not implemented yet, so the app will always fetch the configuration from the API until ticket #920 is done_

**Below is a list of the json files that can be configured:**

## 9.1. Available languages
The app can be configured to support multiple languages. The list of available languages is defined in `SmartFunRevamp/assets/json/available_languages.json` file. The format of the file is:
```
[
  {
    "code": "en",
    "name": "English"
  },
  {
    "code": "es",
    "name": "Espa√±ol"
  }
]
```

## 9.2. Default translated strings
The app can be configured to support multiple languages. The list of available languages is defined in `SmartFunRevamp/assets/json/default_translated_strings_en.json` file for the english file, and the language code changes for every language. The format of the file is:
```
{
  "hello": "Hello",
  "world": "World"
}
```

## 9.3. Parafait defaults
The file should be located at `SmartFunRevamp/assets/json/parafait_defaults.json`. The format of the file is:
```
{
    "data": {
        "ParafaitDefaultContainerDTOList": [
            {
                "DefaultValueName": "CARD_FACE_VALUE",
                "DefaultValue": "0"
            },
            {
                "DefaultValueName": "TOKEN_PRICE",
                "DefaultValue": "10"
            },
            # more items here ...
        ]
    }
}
```

## 9.4. CMS configuration
It contains data to configure data for the app such as: home containers, menu itesm, colors, etc. The file is `SmartFunRevamp/assets/json/example_cms.json`
_TO DO: we need to change the name of this file because is not an exampla anymore, it is the real file that is shipped with the app_
The next items are configured in the same file.

### 9.4.1. Home containers
The containers in the home page can be of different types. The available types are:

- CARDS: shows the widget with the list of the cards of the user
- LINKS: shows a list of links to other pages inside the app
- CAROUSEL: shows a carousel of images with links to external pages loaded inside a webview in the app

The configuration for this containers is made in 2 different places in the json file:

1. `HomePageOrder` is a list of the containers that will be shown in the home page. The `widget` value points to a container defined in the next section.

This is the format of the `HomePageOrder` list:

```
  "HomePageOrder": [
    {
      "title": "My Tickets",
      "position": 4,
      "widget": "CARDS",
      "is_visible": true
    },
    {
      "title": "Quick Links",
      "position": 10,
      "widget": "LINKS",
      "is_visible": true,
      "display_section": "QUICKLINKS"
    },
    {
      "title": "Promotions",
      "position": 2,
      "widget": "CAROUSEL",
      "is_visible": true,
      "display_section": "PROMOS_1"
    },
    {
      "title": "More Actions",
      "position": 3,
      "widget": "LINKS",
      "is_visible": true,
      "display_section": "MORE_ACTIONS"
    }
  ],
```

2. `CMSModulePageDTOList` is the actual data pointed from the previous section
```

```



### 9.4.2. Menu items
Menu items are inside the key `CMSModuleMenuDTOList`

The available items keys for configuration are:

- SMARTFUN_MENU_HEADER
- SMARTFUN_MENU_FOOTER
- SMARTFUN_MENU_CARD_DETAILS
- SMARTFUN_MENU_MORE

the configuration for this items is the following:

```
"CMSModuleMenuDTOList": [
  {
    "CMSMenusDTOList": [
      {
        "Name": "SMARTFUN_MENU_FOOTER",
        "Type": "FOOTER",
        "Active": true,
        "CMSMenuItemsDTOList": [
          {
            "ItemName": "HOME",
            "ItemUrl": "https://parafaitapihqdemo.parafait.com/images/ftHomeIcon.png",
            "Target": "sf://home",
            "Active": true,
            "DisplayOrder": 1,
            "DisplayName": "Home",
          },
          # More items here ...
        ],
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "CMSMenusDTOList": [
      {
        "Name": "SMARTFUN_MENU_CARD_DETAILS",
        "Type": "CARD_DETAILS",
        "Active": true
        "CMSMenuItemsDTOList": [
          {
            "ItemName": "BONUS",
            "ItemUrl": "https://parafaitapihqdemo.parafait.com/images/ftHomeIcon.png",
            "Active": true,
            "DisplayOrder": 1,
            "DisplayName": "Bonus",
            "CreditType": 5
          },
          # More items here ...
        ],
      }
    ]
  },
  # More items here ...
],
```

**Particular cases an exceptions**

- SMARTFUN_MENU_CARD_DETAILS has an extra key `CreditType` that is used to filter the cards by credit type. In this case the `Target` key is not used. The values are:
  - 0: credits
  - 1: loyalty
  - 2: tickets
  - 5: bonus 
  - 6: time 
- PLAY: in this case the `Target` key is not the internal route inside the app, but the url to open inside the webview.

This is the structure:

```
  "CMSModuleColorsHome": {
    "upper_half": "#FFCFF8FF",

  },
```

# 10. App version and description.
The publicly visible app version is taken from `SmartFunRevamp/pubspec.yaml` file. The version is defined in the variable `version`. This should match with the version defined in the `.env` file

You can also change the app description in that file.

*DO NOT change app name*, because code compiling will fail.
